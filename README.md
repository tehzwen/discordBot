discordBot

July 2022 Update:
- Started a rewrite of this bot after many years! 

## Why?
- Recently have started hosting game servers and other services on local machines and want to allow control (on/off/start/status) abilities for users for these services

## How?
- The bot will be hosted on the same local network as the servers that we want to manage. The bot will have commands such as `/ping <server>` to get a server's status and `/start <server>` etc.
